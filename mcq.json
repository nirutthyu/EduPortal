    "question": "The speaker highlights a significant disadvantage of using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for image recognition, especially with large images. What is this primary disadvantage?",
    "options": [
      "ANNs struggle with introducing non-linearity into the model.",
      "ANNs require too many pooling layers, making them slow.",
      "ANNs treat local pixels the same as pixels far apart, and involve too much computation.",
      "ANNs cannot be used for classification tasks."
    ],
    "answer": "c) ANNs treat local pixels the same as pixels far apart, and involve too much computation."

    "question": "According to the speaker, how do humans typically recognize an image like a koala's face?",
    "options": [
      "By analyzing the entire image at once in a single step.",
      "By detecting small, specific features (like eyes, nose, ears) and then aggregating them into larger patterns.",

      "By using a dense network that connects every neuron to every other neuron."

    "question": "What is the primary function of \"filters\" or \"convolution operations\" in a CNN's feature extraction phase?",
    "options": [
      "To flatten a 2D image into a 1D array for classification.",
      "To introduce non-linearity into the model by converting negative values to zero.",

    "question": "One of the key benefits of the convolution operation, especially when combined with pooling, is that it enables \"location invariant feature detection.\" What does this mean?",
    "options": [
      "It ensures that the computer only recognizes features located in the center of an image.",
      "It means the detected features will always be in the same exact pixel location regardless of input.",
      "It allows the network to detect a feature (e.g., an eye) regardless of where it appears in the image.",
      "It makes the feature maps two-dimensional, preventing them from becoming three-dimensional."
    ],
    "answer": "c) It allows the network to detect a feature (e.g., an eye) regardless of where it appears in the image."

    "options": [
      "That all filters within a CNN share the exact same parameter values.",
